# Repository for multiple models and musings about melanoma drug response dynamics. Including:
1. PySB reproduction and addition to Melanoma Three-State Model (originally in  R) - in scripts folder
2. Simulated spike-in experiments for single-cell drug response assay (LSD_spikeIn) and lineage tracing (barcoding_spikeIn, includes barcoding_stats)
3. Example general stochastic cell proliferation dynamics (stoch_expgrowth)
4. Multi-Objective Parameter Estimation (MOPE) of three-state model to experimental data (data from /mixing_data experiments) - in scripts folder
5. Simulation outputs in /data (as .npy arrays of .pkl objects) and /plots
